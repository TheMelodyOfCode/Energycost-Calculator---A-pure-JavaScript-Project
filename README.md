# Energycost-Calculator & Spock the Game
### JavaScript

This project was my very first big project in Javascript.  
It covers the fundameltals of JS and  as you might noticed I used classes.  
I know classes are and old technologie and only rarly used nowadays.  
But this is an old project by now.  
**Hindsight**  
In hindsight, after reviewing this project after serveral month.  
I noticed soo many things that I wouldn't do nowadays anymore.  
I will leave this project in here since it can still be useful for people 
in Germany that want to calculate their energieprices and keep a record of it.  
If I find the time I will convert this project to React (hooks only , no classes :-)) and attache it to Firebase.

### Spock the Game
As a feature I added a little game
