# Energycost-Calculator---A-pure-JavaScript-Project
This project was all about working with JavaScript ONLY.

I came up with this project at the beginning of the year when Russia invaded Ukrain
and the Energycost in Germany were rising exponentially from one moment to another.

There are still a few things that need to be done.
Please see issues for that.
