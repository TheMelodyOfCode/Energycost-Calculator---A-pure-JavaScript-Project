# Energycost-Calculator - It's build only in Javascript in order to learn to code in JS.
This project was all about working with JavaScript.
Of course it is not recommended to build a whole Website only in JS since it can be blockt in the browser.
But this website was not made for public use but instead for me to learn about coding in Javascript.

I came up with this project at the beginning of the year when Russia invaded Ukrain.
and the Energycost in Germany were rising exponentially from one moment to another.

There are still a few things that need to be done.
Please see issues for that.
